## Chinese Whist

This repo contains a ruleset for a game called Chinese Whist, a type of diminishing contract whist that was taught to a group of friends and myself by a history teacher called Dr Turner in secondary school.

This is similar to other forms of whist that exist (being most similar to [Serbian Whist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serbian_whist)), but after looking around online I haven't been able to find this exact ruleset, and so wanted to document it.

Files in this repo:  
- **rules.md**: The rules of the game.
- **scoring.md**: The various scoring systems that can be used.

Contributions are welcome, especially to add scoring systems or setups.
